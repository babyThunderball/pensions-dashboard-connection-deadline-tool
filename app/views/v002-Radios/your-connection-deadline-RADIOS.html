      <p class="govuk-body">
        Pension schemes will connect to dashboards over time according to their size and type. The current proposed deadlines are set out below. Check the final regulations when they are published later this year to confirm your deadline.
      </p>

      <p class="govuk-body">
        Your connection deadline is calculated based on the total number of active and deferred members across all sections of the scheme at the scheme year end that fell between 1 April 2020 and 31 March 2021. You should not include pensioner members in your count. If you did not have 100 or more active and deferred members at scheme year end 2020 to 2021, but you do now, see the section on ‘schemes newly in scope’ below.
      </p>

      <p class="govuk-body">
        Your deadline applies to the whole scheme. If your scheme has multiple sections or your members have additional voluntary contributions (AVCs) in the scheme, these will all need to be connected by the same deadline. You will need to work with your administrators and AVC providers to ensure your whole scheme is connected.
      </p>

      <p class="govuk-body">Your connection deadline will not change if your scheme changes size, unless you fall out of scope of the requirements entirely, for example if all your members become pensioner members.
