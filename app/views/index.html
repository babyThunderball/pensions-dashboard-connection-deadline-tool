        Rough prototypes of the tool. There are currently two versions: one using radios for the first question (recommended for accessibility purposes) and one using the select component for the first question.
      </p>

      <p>
        They're responsive, but they've been designed in a one-third column to simulate their likely placement in the right-hand column.
